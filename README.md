This script generates word files from Excel files downloaded from Verint.
Download with the following settings: 
Columns: All Response Data from the Current Survey

Content: Formatted Data - Choice Labels
Column Headers: Question Text *

The script is utilizing information in the column name in various ways. 

One of them utilizes the letter after the question number:
it combines question "3A: What's the matter"  and "3B: How come?" in the word file.

So to make the best use out of the script, combined questions should follow this A/B naming scheme.
